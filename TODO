migrate to Iterator instead of Womo::Iterator
expunge Set::Relation (too much noise, want to diverge interface)
change Relation interface to have ->grep ->[h]slice? ->where?
    - restrict -> grep (where?)
    - project  -> some kind of slice?
    - join     -> join (fights with Array->join ?)
    - union    -> union
    - semidifference -> semidifference

- left outer join
- group by
- functions: sum(), count(), max(), etc...
- deal with nulls
- extention
- matching (another name for semijoin) (this is not associative)

make a Tuple::Lazy (?) interface to use tie to lazily make
$t->{'foo'} work (for depot database and catalog)

make some kind of "all" thing for iterators that is fast
