migrate to Iterator instead of Womo::Iterator
expunge Set::Relation (too much noise, want to diverge interface)
mv t/01.t and t/restriction_sqla.t to lib/*/Relation/*/Test.pm
make Relation be of Tuple instead of HashRef
change Relation interface to have ->grep ->[h]slice? 
    - restrict -> grep
    - project  -> some kind of slice?
    - join     -> join (fights with Array->join ?)
    - union    -> union
    - semidifference -> semidifference

- left outer join
- group by
- functions: sum(), count(), max(), etc...
- deal with nulls
- extention
